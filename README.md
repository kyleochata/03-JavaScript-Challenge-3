# 03-JavaScript-Challenge-3

## Description

In this project, I aimed to create a random password generator. In today's age, people are required to have many unique passwords to ensure that if one website has a data breach, the rest of their accounts should be safe due to using different passwords. It can be a struggle to come up with unique passwords on the spot and this project aims to make it easy for the user. We were given starter code for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get ourselves started. The initial site looked like  the first screenshot provided, with no functioning script when you clicked the button. The second screenshot is of the starter JavaScript code that I had to make functional. After writing the code necessary, the overall look of the site stayed the same, but when you click the button, the script will lead the user through various input criteria for parameters to create the password. Once the parameters are set and the password is generated, the generated password will display in the textarea above the button. The refactored site can be found [here](https://kyleochata.github.io/03-JavaScript-Challenge-3/).
